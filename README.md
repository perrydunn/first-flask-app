# My First Flask App

Having followed Miguel Grinburg's excellent [mega-tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

`$ pip install -r requirments.txt`

For testing with no real email (run in the background with ampersand):

`$ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:8025 &`

You can use `$ flask shell` to play around. Else fire it up with `flask run` and play!
